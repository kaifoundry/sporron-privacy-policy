# 🔐 KILT Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

## 📘 About

KILT is a blockchain protocol for issuing **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)** and **verifiable credentials**. This project specifically powers the legal compliance frontend pages for:

- 🔒 **Privacy Policy** – outlining how we collect, store, and protect user data.
- 📜 **Terms and Conditions** – defining the rules and regulations for using KILT-based applications and services.

These pages are a legal requirement and serve to build user trust through transparency and user-first design.
